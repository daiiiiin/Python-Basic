# Python-Basic
This is my study record.
*** 
### 1. Overview  
I've been learning Python for two years now. I thought I'd post some of the material I studied and practiced when I first started learning. I know this won't help anyone reading this because you all have great skills, but I'm uploading this git to keep a record of my learning.  

### 2. Study contents  
- inputs, outputs, declaring variables, and using the most basic loops and conditional statements  
- Using libraries and modules  
- Make Class and functions  
- Practice with the pandas and numpy libraries, which are fundamental to data manipulation.  
- Simple deep learning (keras, torch, tensorflow)  
- Crawling basics (webdriver, BeautifulSoup, selenium)  
There are python file in 'practice' folder and there are example data in 'example dataset' folder.  

### 3. Conclusion
I was able to learn the basics of Python and experience deep learning and crawling. I hope to build on this foundation and create something great in the future.
